# Heart Disease Prediction App ❤️

A lightweight Python-based web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user-provided health metrics.

## 🚀 Features

- Loads pre‑trained ML models:
  - `main_model.pkl`
  - `pca_model.pkl`
  - `scaler.pkl`
- Provides health tips via `tips_file.py`
- Built with simple user interface (CLI or Streamlit)

## ⚙️ Installation / Setup

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saswattulo/heart-disease-prediction-app.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (recommended to use a virtual environment)

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # Linux/macOS
   # .\venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows PowerShell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ▶️ Usage

### Via Command Line (CLI)

```bash
python heart-disease-prediction-app.py
```

* The app will prompt for inputs like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.
* You’ll receive a prediction: **"At risk"** or **"Not at risk"**, supplemented with health tips.

### Via Streamlit (if supported)

```bash
streamlit run heart-disease-prediction-app.py
```

* Opens a web interface to input fields and view predictions interactively.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters health parameters.
2. Data is standardized using the pre-loaded scaler.
3. PCA reduces data dimensionality.
4. The final prediction is made using the classification model.
5. Displayed result includes personalized tips from `tips_file.py`.

---

## 🛠️ Customization

* **Retrain the model**: Swap out the `.pkl` files with your own trained versions.
* **Update tips**: Edit or expand tips in `tips_file.py`.
* **UI enhancements**: Turn CLI into Streamlit or Flask-based web app.

---

## 🧪 Example Run

```
Enter age: 55
Enter cholesterol: 240
Enter resting blood pressure: 140
...
Prediction: You are at risk of heart disease.
Tip: Consider regular exercise and avoid high-fat diet.
```

### Tips to finalize:

- Replace the CLI usage example with actual input fields your script expects.
- Add a demo GIF or screenshot in a `docs/` folder and embed it in the README (`![Demo](docs/demo.gif)`).
- If you deploy via Streamlit or Flask, add a "Live Demo" link near the top.

Let me know if you want help generating visuals or deploying/publicizing the app!
